==============

Switched all variable types to C99 data-types. Doing so fixed 64-bits support as well as weird crashes.

Detected a few memory corruptions with Valgrind and fixed those accordingly.

Added RS-97 support based on the libSDL port.


Removals
========

Removed the GX (Wii and Gamecube) specific code, for mostly maintainability reasons.

The less code, the better.
